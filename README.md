# Fuel Price Request
### Description
This is a small tool I created to help streamline the creation of an email that was sent multiple times per day as part of my Operations role for an aircraft management company.

### Dependencies
Install the required modules with `pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt`.

### dotenv
The `.env` file should consist of the following three variables:

```
ops="the.ops@email.com"
bcc="the.recipients@email.com"
file="path/to/files/airport-codes.csv"
```
